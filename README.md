# üß† Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Using oneAPI from Intel(R)  

**Predicting Alzheimer's diagnosis using machine learning with explainable AI insights**  

This project analyzes a comprehensive Alzheimer's prediction dataset to identify key risk factors and build predictive models. Combining data preprocessing, feature engineering, and Random Forest classification, it provides insights into:  

üîç **Key Features Analyzed**:  
- Demographic factors (Age, Gender, Country)  
- Lifestyle indicators (Physical Activity, Smoking/Alcohol habits)  
- Medical history (Diabetes, Hypertension, Cholesterol)  
- Genetic markers (APOE-Œµ4 allele status)  
- Socioeconomic factors (Education Level, Income, Employment)  

**Technical Implementation**:  
```plaintext
- Data Cleaning: Missing value handling & categorical encoding  
- Feature Scaling: Standardization of numerical features  
- Model Development: Random Forest Classifier with hyperparameter tuning  
- Explainable AI: Feature importance analysis and visualization  
- Evaluation: Accuracy metrics & confusion matrix analysis  
```

**Key Results**:  
üìà **Model Performance**:  
- Training Accuracy: 69.60%  
- Test Accuracy: 69.63%  
- Confusion Matrix:
